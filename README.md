# Program-for-election-contest-among-five-candidates
An election is contested by 5 candidates. The candidates are numbered 1 to 5 and the voting is done by marking the candidate number on the ballot paper. Write a C++ program to read the ballots and count the votes cast for each candidate using an array. In case, a number read is outside the range 1 to 5, the ballot should be considered as a ‘spoilt ballot’ and the program should also count the number of spoilt ballots.
